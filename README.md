A sniper bot is like a robot that trades cryptocurrencies automatically. It's called "sniper" because it acts quickly and precisely, just like a sniper in combat.

To find good trades, the bot looks at things like how prices are changing, how much people are trading, and overall market trends. When it spots a promising trade, it buys or sells cryptocurrency without needing a person to do it.
